# V2MemeMe
This is the completed version of memeMe iOS app. The first version of memeMe _(memeMeV1)_ enables a user to take a picture, and add text at the top and bottom to form a meme, and share that meme on Facebook, Twitter, SMS or email. In this version sent memes will appear in a tab view with two tabs: a table view and collection view.
